'''Simple example of using the SWIG generated TWS wrapper to request historical
data from interactive brokers.
Note:
* Communication with TWS is asynchronous; requests to TWS are made through the
EPosixClientSocket class and TWS responds at some later time via the functions
in our EWrapper subclass.
* If you're using a demo account TWS will only respond with a limited time
period, no matter what is requested. Also the data returned is probably wholly
unreliable.
